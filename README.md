Here's just a dump of files I got together in order to get my modern macOS machines to print through my very very old Samsung ML-1610 laser printer. This printer's a little gem that with some software support, still works quite well.

My detailed blog post introducing ml1610-blaster is here: <a href="https://dawning.ca/2017/ml1610-blaster-drivers-for-samsung-ml1610-on-macos-high-sierra/">ml1610-blaster on dawning.ca</a>.

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Download the release zip: <a href="https://github.com/docdawning/ml1610-blaster/archive/v1.0.zip" target="_new">here's a link</a></li>
  <li>Unzip the release zip somewhere, pay attention where.</li>
  <li>Run the splix installer. It WILL FAIL. But it seems to succeed enough in some way that matters.</li>
  <li>Open your System Preferences, go in to Printers and click the plus button to add a new one.</li>
  <li>Opt to select your own driver and navigate to the unzipped files, pick the <em>ml1610.ppd</em> file.
</ol>

The video should appear above, but it may be slow because it's a massive GIF, it can also be watched on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQFGFRP_Jz4" target="_new">here</a>
