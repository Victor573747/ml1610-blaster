Here's just a dump of files I got together in order to get my modern macOS machines to print through my very very old Samsung ML-1610 laser printer. This printer's a little gem that with some software support, still works quite well.

My detailed blog post introducing ml1610-blaster is here: <a href="https://dawning.ca/2017/ml1610-blaster-drivers-for-samsung-ml1610-on-macos-high-sierra/">ml1610-blaster on dawning.ca</a>.

The video should appear above, but it may be slow, it can also be watched on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQFGFRP_Jz4" target="_new">here</a>
